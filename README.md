# Professional-Strategies-for-Statisticians
The Professional Strategies Working Group started in the NC State Department of Statistics as a way to provide career-focused mentoring to women and URM graduate students.

There are many factors that impact the retention and graduation of URM students. Two main factors are social integration and academic integration (Vaquera 2007). Social integration refers to a sense of belonging (Hurtado and Carter 1997) and can be measured by participation in both formal student groups and in informal discussions outside of class. This type of belonging can also be encouraged through ethnically homogenous networks that can provide emotional and culturally competent support (Spalter-Roth et al. 2013).

Academic integration refers to URM students receiving individual, high-quality, and scholarly career advice and resources from a wide array of faculty members (Noy and Ray 2012, Vaquera 2007). This support is not limited to an ethnically homogenous network. In fact, student success is improved when mentoring occurs both within an ethnically homogenous network and across more heterogenous network.

Students who are well-integrated into their departments are retained at higher rates (Vaquera 2007), graduate at higher rates (Vaquera 2007), and experience more early career success (Spalter-Roth et al. 2013) than students who are not mentored and sponsored in these two distinct but not mutually exclusive ways.

While the PSWG is focused on women and URM students, it is open to all. We try to meet monthly to discuss articles and books about student success as well as early career success. Topics that have been covered include recognizing and understanding professional norms, finding sponsorship and mentoring, giving talks, and using conferences to learn and network.
